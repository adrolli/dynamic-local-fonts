# Do not copy the /src-folder into your project
Not for distribution or intented for usage! These are working files and code for creating and testing CSS for the webfonts. I did no security tests. Of course these files are not needed to use the webfonts.

## Static CSS Generator
Call this PHP-file from a browser to create the CSS-files for all webfonts in all-fonts.csv. Does not delete or overwrite existing files. A very basic script but it works fine for me.

## Static CSS Tester
After using the Generartor you can click on the headings to see if your fonts are working.

## All Fonts CSV
Basic information needed to build all the CSS.

## Font Face Full CSS
Just a demo file with all different font styles.
