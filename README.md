# Dynamic Local Fonts

Using free fonts (Google Fonts and others) locally and dynamically. WORK IN PROGRESS.

## Why?

I love fonts. For my own project I wanted to use Google Fonts as well as some icon fonts without using the Google Fonts CDN. There are good plugins and code snippets for WordPress and hosting Google Fonts locally became very popular because of this GDPR / DSGVO thing. But I wanted to be able to use the fonts dynamically. Means per page, post or archive. So I started to develop my own solution selecting one of the 900 available Google Fonts in WordPress and loading only this Font (plus my default font) for this single page.

## Unleash Creativity

### Use my WordPress Child Theme

You may use my child theme (coming soon) as starting point or develop your own thing. WORK IN PROGRESS.

### With a WordPress Plugin, Starter Theme or other Websoftware

Use it in your WordPress Plugin, Dyna or any other Starter Theme or in other CMS or Frameworks.

#### Get started

1) Use the font-list copy to build your font-selector dropdown. I copied that in an ACF-Field that is used in Posts, Pages, Categories and other Taxonomies. That is extremely easy to do and to manage.

2) Copy the code from functions.php into your functions.php (only WordPress of course).

3) Copy the fonts-folder into your theme. You can clone it from Github.

## Ideas, Contributions
