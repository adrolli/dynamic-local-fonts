# Dynamic Local Fonts

Using free fonts (Google Fonts and others) locally and dynamically. WORK IN PROGRESS.

## Why?

I love fonts. For my own project I wanted to use Google Fonts as well as some icon fonts without using the Google Fonts CDN. There are good plugins and code snippets for WordPress and hosting Google Fonts locally became very popular because of this GDPR / DSGVO thing. But I wanted to be able to use the fonts dynamically. Means per page, post or archive. So I started to develop my own solution selecting one of the 900 available Google Fonts in WordPress and loading only this Font (plus my default font) for this single page.

## Unleash Creativity

You may use my child theme as starting point or develop your own thing. More coming soon.
